      <p class="lede">MSDS 682 equips students to process continuous data streams at scale and in real time.</p>
      <p>This hands-on course teaches students how to process and analyze real-time data streams using Apache Kafka, Python, Confluent tools, and related data engineering workflows. Students will produce and consume Kafka messages, build streaming workflows, interpret streaming outputs, and use GitHub for code management and collaboration.</p>
