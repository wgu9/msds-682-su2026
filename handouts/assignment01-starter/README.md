# Assignment 1 Student Starter

This starter matches the required files and commands in the official
[Assignment 1 specification](https://wgu9.github.io/msds-682-su2026/#/handouts/assignment01). Complete every block between
`CODE START HERE` and `CODE ENDS HERE`; do not remove the markers, docstrings,
or explanatory comments.

## 1. Set up Python 3.11.14

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Configure Confluent Cloud

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then fill in your own Kafka credentials. Never
commit or submit `.env`.

The four programs use the same topic. The default is
`msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1`; change `ASSIGNMENT1_TOPIC_NAME` only if your
Demo 01 topic has a different name.

## 3. Complete and test the starter

Run the credential-free tests before using Confluent:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The starter tests are expected to fail until the marked code blocks are
implemented. They do not replace the required real Confluent runs.

## 4. Run Demo 02A-02D assignment programs

Run all commands from this starter's top-level directory:

```bash
python src/producer_sync.py --run-id assignment1
python src/producer_async.py --run-id assignment1
python src/producer_compare.py --run-id assignment1 --messages 20000 --batch-size 500 --seed 682
python src/analyze_results.py --input results/producer_benchmark.csv --output results/producer_benchmark.png
python src/producer_serialization.py --run-id assignment1
```

The programs write the required secret-free reports to `evidence/` and the
benchmark data and graph to `results/`.

## 5. Write the report and disclose AI assistance

Copy `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` to `report.md` and complete every section.

- If you did not use AI assistance, select `No` in `report.md`.
- If you used any AI assistance, select `Yes`, copy
  `AI_USAGE_TEMPLATE.md` to `AI_USAGE.md`, and submit the completed log.
- The disclosure is required when AI is used. It does not itself earn extra
  credit. The optional AI-review point has additional evidence requirements in
  the assignment specification.

## 6. Package the submission

Rename the folder to `assignment1_<usf_username>`, remove `.env`, `.venv`, and
cache files, and submit `assignment1_<usf_username>.zip` to Canvas. Do not
remove the completed source files, reports, benchmark CSV, graph, or report.
