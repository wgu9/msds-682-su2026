# Demo 01: Create a Kafka Topic with Python

**This demo creates a real Kafka topic in Confluent Cloud using Python.**

Important: this demo creates the topic only. It does not produce Kafka messages yet.

Messages/events are created later by producer demos. Demo 01 only creates the destination that future producers will write to.

> Key classroom point: get Kafka API keys from Confluent, keep them in `.env`, load them with `python-dotenv`, then use `AdminClient` to create the topic. After this demo, Confluent should show one topic row, but production and consumption may still be empty.

## Demo Goal

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What are we creating? | A Kafka topic named `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` |
| Are we creating messages? | No. This demo creates no messages. |
| Why create a topic first? | A producer needs a topic destination before it can send events. |
| What should Confluent show? | One topic row with 3 partitions. Production/consumption can be empty. |
| What comes later? | Producer code that writes event messages into this topic. |

## What You Should See at the End

In Confluent Cloud, open your cluster and go to Topics. You should see a row like:

| Topic name | Partitions | Production | Consumption |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` | `3` | empty or `--` | empty or `--` |

That is the expected screenshot result. Empty production/consumption is correct because no producer has sent messages yet.

Run:

```bash
python demo01_create_topic.py --run-id lec2
```

Expected terminal output:

```json
{
  "status": "created",
  "topic": "msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1",
  "partitions": 3,
  "replication_factor": 3,
  "cleanup_policy": "delete",
  "bootstrap_host": "YOUR_CLUSTER_HOST:9092",
  "has_username": true,
  "has_password": true
}
```

If you run it again, `status` should become `already_exists`. That is correct. The script is safe to rerun.

The report also includes `partitions_on_cluster`, read back from cluster metadata. Note that `already_exists` does not fully validate the existing topic config. This script reports the existing partition count, but it does not verify `cleanup.policy` or the actual replication factor.

The script also writes:

```text
outputs/runs/lec2/demo01_topic_creation/topic_report.json
```

## The Example Topic

We will create this ridesharing event topic:

```text
msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1
```

Think of the topic as a future event history for trips. Right now the topic is empty; later producer demos will append event messages.

| Topic concept | In this demo |
|---|---|
| Topic name | `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` |
| Future event examples | `trip_requested`, `driver_matched`, `trip_started`, `trip_completed` |
| Key idea | Demo 01 creates the destination; later producers send trip events into it |
| Why versioned | `v1` leaves room for a future schema/topic change |

## High-Value Details to Notice

| Detail | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Topic name is lowercase and versioned | This follows a production-style naming convention and avoids vague names like `test` |
| `partitions=3` | Kafka can split one topic into parallel logs; later this affects ordering and consumer scaling |
| `replication_factor=3` | Class default for fault tolerance; allowed values may depend on managed Kafka cluster settings |
| `cleanup.policy=delete` | Old records expire by retention policy; this is the normal event-log behavior |
| `topic_exists(...)` before `create_topics(...)` | The script is idempotent: running it twice does not break |
| JSON report has no secret | You can show the result without exposing the API key or password |

## Topic Config vs Message Structure

Creating a topic does not define the data structure of future messages.

Demo 01 defines only topic-level settings:

| Topic-level item | Defined here? | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `topic_name` | Yes | The Kafka destination name |
| `num_partitions` | Yes | How many partition logs the topic has |
| `replication_factor` | Yes | How many broker copies Confluent keeps |
| `cleanup.policy` | Yes | How Kafka eventually removes old records |
| message key shape | No | Chosen by producer code later |
| message value shape | No | Chosen by producer code later |
| Avro/JSON schema | No | Added later only if the producer uses Schema Registry or validation |

Kafka itself stores message bytes. If the producer sends raw JSON, strings, or bytes, Kafka does not enforce a schema. If the course later uses Avro plus Schema Registry, then the schema registered in Schema Registry becomes the authority for the message value structure.

In this demo, the topic is an empty log container. It is ready for producer writes, but it does not yet say that a message must have fields like `trip_id`, `rider_id`, or `event_type`.

## Read the Core Code First

This is the important logic before you run anything.

```python
from confluent_kafka.admin import AdminClient, NewTopic
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os


def load_config():
    # Reads .env and makes values available through os.getenv(...).
    # This keeps API keys out of the Python source file.
    load_dotenv()
    return {
        # Kafka broker address. This tells the client which cluster to contact.
        "bootstrap.servers": os.getenv("BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS"),

        # Confluent Cloud requires encrypted SASL authentication.
        "security.protocol": os.getenv("SECURITY_PROTOCOL", "SASL_SSL"),
        "sasl.mechanisms": os.getenv("SASL_MECHANISMS", "PLAIN"),

        # SASL_USERNAME is the Kafka API key.
        # SASL_PASSWORD is the Kafka API secret.
        "sasl.username": os.getenv("SASL_USERNAME"),
        "sasl.password": os.getenv("SASL_PASSWORD"),
    }


def topic_exists(admin_client, topic_name):
    # Ask Kafka for cluster metadata.
    # If the topic is already there, we do not create it again.
    return topic_name in admin_client.list_topics(timeout=10).topics


def create_topic(admin_client, topic_name):
    if topic_exists(admin_client, topic_name):
        return "already_exists"

    # This creates only the topic metadata/log structure.
    # It does not create any Kafka messages.
    topic = NewTopic(
        topic_name,

        # Three partitions means Kafka stores this topic as three ordered logs.
        # Kafka ordering is guaranteed inside one partition, not globally.
        num_partitions=3,

        # Three replicas means Confluent keeps copies for fault tolerance.
        replication_factor=3,

        # "delete" means Kafka eventually deletes old records by retention.
        # It is the normal setting for an event-history topic.
        config={"cleanup.policy": "delete"},
    )
    # create_topics returns a future. result(...) waits for broker confirmation.
    futures = admin_client.create_topics([topic])
    futures[topic_name].result(timeout=30)
    return "created"


conf = load_config()
# AdminClient is for Kafka admin operations: create topic, list topics,
# inspect cluster metadata. It is not a Producer.
admin_client = AdminClient(conf)
status = create_topic(admin_client, "msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1")
print(status)
```

## What Each Piece Does

| Piece | What it does | Why students need it |
|---|---|---|
| Confluent API key | Username/secret pair that lets Python connect to your Kafka cluster | Without it, the Python client cannot authenticate |
| `.env` | Local file that stores secrets outside source code | Keeps credentials out of GitHub, Canvas, screenshots, and AI tools |
| `python-dotenv` | Reads `.env` and loads values into `os.getenv(...)` | Lets code use secrets without hardcoding them |
| `AdminClient` | Kafka admin client from `confluent-kafka` | Creates topics, checks metadata, and manages Kafka resources |
| `NewTopic` | Topic definition object | Specifies topic name, partitions, replication factor, and config |
| `topic_exists` | Metadata check | Makes the script idempotent, so rerunning does not fail |
| JSON report | Secret-free run evidence | TA can inspect result without seeing your API secret |

## What This Demo Does Not Do

| Not included yet | Why |
|---|---|
| Produce messages | Producer is the next concept after topic creation |
| Consume messages | Consumer needs messages to read first |
| Define a schema | Schema/serialization comes later |
| Show nonzero production metrics | No messages are written in Demo 01 |
| Prove topic ordering | Ordering matters after messages are produced into partitions |

## Relation to Producer and Consumer Examples

Conceptually, producer demos come after this topic-creation demo: first create a destination topic, then produce messages into a topic.

The Lec 2 topic creation demo, producer demo, and consumer-offset demo now use the same topic name and same ridesharing background:

```text
msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1
```

The Lec 2 producer demos use Confluent Cloud directly. They write to the same topic that Demo 01 creates.

The sequence is:

| Demo | Topic/storage used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Demo 01 topic creation | Confluent topic `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` | Create the empty Kafka topic |
| Demo 02A sync-style producer | Confluent topic `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` | Write trip events and wait after each message |
| Demo 02B async producer | Confluent topic `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` | Write trip events asynchronously |
| Demo 02C async vs sync-style comparison | Confluent topic `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` | Compare producer wait patterns |
| Demo 02D serialization producer | Confluent topic `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` | Serialize trip events before sending |
| Demo 03A–03D consumers | Confluent topic `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` | Read, commit, replay, rebalance, and consume trip events with asyncio |

Example message values used by producer/consumer demos look like:

```json
{
  "trip_id": "trip_981",
  "event_type": "driver_matched",
  "rider_id": "rider-981",
  "driver_id": "driver-004",
  "zone": "south",
  "event_time": "2026-07-04T10:00:01Z"
}
```

Kafka does not automatically connect producer examples to a topic just because it exists. The producer code must explicitly use the topic name `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1`.

## Step 1: Create a Working Folder

```bash
mkdir -p msds682-demos
cd msds682-demos
```

## Step 2: Create and Activate Python

Recommended:

```bash
uv python install 3.11
uv venv --python 3.11 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Fallback:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## Step 3: Install Packages

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install confluent-kafka python-dotenv
```

## Step 4: Get Kafka API Keys from Confluent

In Confluent Cloud:

1. Open your environment and Kafka cluster.
2. Go to API keys.
3. Create a Kafka cluster API key.
4. Copy the API key and API secret immediately.
5. Copy your cluster bootstrap server, usually ending in `:9092`.

> Use a Kafka cluster API key, not your Confluent website password.

You need three values from Confluent:

| `.env` field | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` | Kafka cluster endpoint / bootstrap server |
| `SASL_USERNAME` | Kafka API key |
| `SASL_PASSWORD` | Kafka API secret |

## Step 5: Create `.env`

Create a file named `.env` in the same folder as `demo01_create_topic.py`.

```text
# Kafka cluster bootstrap server.
# Get this from your Confluent cluster settings.
# Keep only host:port here; do not include https://.
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=YOUR_CLUSTER_HOST:9092

# Confluent Cloud Kafka connections use SASL over SSL.
# For this course, leave these two values as shown.
SECURITY_PROTOCOL=SASL_SSL
SASL_MECHANISMS=PLAIN

# Kafka API key from Confluent.
# This is the username for the Python Kafka client.
SASL_USERNAME=YOUR_KAFKA_API_KEY

# Kafka API secret from Confluent.
# This is the password for the Python Kafka client.
# Never share, screenshot, commit, or paste this value into AI tools.
SASL_PASSWORD=YOUR_KAFKA_API_SECRET

# Topic name to create.
# You may customize the middle/name part if the instructor asks you to.
DEMO01_TOPIC_NAME=msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1
```

Example shape, with fake values:

```text
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=pkc-abc12.us-west2.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092
SECURITY_PROTOCOL=SASL_SSL
SASL_MECHANISMS=PLAIN
SASL_USERNAME=ABCD1234EFGH5678
SASL_PASSWORD=fakeSecretDoNotUse_fakeSecretDoNotUse_fakeSecretDoNotUse
DEMO01_TOPIC_NAME=msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1
```

Never submit or screenshot real `.env` values.

Quick meaning of each `.env` field:

| Field | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` | Kafka cluster address | `pkc-abc12.us-west2.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092` |
| `SECURITY_PROTOCOL` | Encrypted auth protocol | `SASL_SSL` |
| `SASL_MECHANISMS` | SASL auth mechanism | `PLAIN` |
| `SASL_USERNAME` | Kafka API key | `ABCD1234EFGH5678` |
| `SASL_PASSWORD` | Kafka API secret | do not display |
| `DEMO01_TOPIC_NAME` | Topic this script creates | `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1` |

## Step 6: Download the Script

Download:

[demo01_create_topic.py](handouts/demo01_create_topic.py)

Put it in the same folder as `.env`.

Your folder should look like this:

```text
msds682-demos/
  .env
  demo01_create_topic.py
  .venv/
```

## Step 7: Run Demo 01

```bash
python demo01_create_topic.py --run-id lec2
```

If successful, you should see JSON with:

- `status`: `created` or `already_exists`
- `topic`: `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1`
- `partitions`: `3`
- `replication_factor`: `3`
- `has_username`: `true`
- `has_password`: `true`

The report deliberately does not print your API key or secret.

Then check Confluent Cloud:

1. Open the cluster.
2. Click Topics.
3. Search for `msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1`.
4. Confirm it has 3 partitions.
5. Do not worry if Production and Consumption are blank; that means no messages have been produced yet.

## Optional: Use Your Own Topic Name

If many students share one cluster, add your USF username or initials:

```bash
python demo01_create_topic.py \
  --topic msds682.demo01.trip-events.yourname.v1 \
  --run-id lec2
```

## Optional Reference: Delete a Topic

Do not run this in the normal demo. It is here so you can recognize the common admin operation.

Deleting a Kafka topic removes the topic and its stored messages. In this Demo 01 topic there are no messages yet, but in real projects deletion can destroy data.

```python
from confluent_kafka.admin import AdminClient


def delete_topic(admin_client, topic_name):
    # delete_topics also returns {topic_name: Future}.
    # result(...) waits until Kafka accepts the delete request.
    futures = admin_client.delete_topics([topic_name], operation_timeout=30)
    futures[topic_name].result(timeout=30)
    print(f"Deleted topic: {topic_name}")


# Example only. Do not run unless the instructor asks.
conf = load_config()
admin_client = AdminClient(conf)
delete_topic(admin_client, "msds682.demo01.trip-events.v1")
```

Safer production habit: before deletion, list topics, confirm the exact topic name, and check whether any producers or consumers still depend on it.

## Common Problems

| Error or symptom | Most likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Missing required .env values` | `.env` is missing or in the wrong folder | Put `.env` next to the script or run from the folder containing `.env` |
| Authentication failure | Wrong API key/secret or copied website password | Create a Kafka cluster API key in Confluent |
| Timeout | Bootstrap server is wrong or network is blocked | Recopy the cluster bootstrap server |
| Topic already exists | You already created it | This is fine; continue |
| Secret appears in screenshot | `.env` or hardcoded config is visible | Do not share the screenshot; rotate the API key if exposed |

## Why We Do Not Hardcode Secrets

Older classroom examples sometimes showed credentials directly in code for teaching speed. In this course, use `.env` instead:

```python
# Do not do this:
"sasl.password": "real-secret-in-source-code"

# Do this:
"sasl.password": os.getenv("SASL_PASSWORD")
```

The engineering habit matters more than this small demo: production code should not hardcode secrets.
